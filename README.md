# Charles-Book-Club-CBC-Data-Analysis-Report

The Charles Book Club (CBC) is a company that sells specialty books through direct marketing, including advertisements in magazines, newspapers, and TV. While CBC has successfully grown its customer base and expanded its book selection, profits have been declining. The company needs to improve its marketing strategy to ensure that promotional efforts lead to actual sales.

The Problem
Although CBC's mailing volume is increasing, profits are decreasing. This means that many promotional efforts are not leading to actual sales. The company needs to: Identify which customers are most likely to buy the book. Avoid sending mail to customers who are unlikely to purchase. Improve the efficiency of marketing campaigns.
To solve this, we used data analysis and predictive modelling to find patterns in customer behaviour and improve the targeting of promotions.
